# Pop : Hyperlinked based summarisation

### AIM:

Get summarized content of hyperlinked wikipedia pages in a pop-up when hovered over it

### Problem:

One can often get into the wikipedia rabbit hole because of extensive use of hyperlinks to wikipedia article

### Solution:

To solve this, we decided to create an application that summarises the contents of the hyperlinked page and displays it as a pop-up over the hyperlinked word

### UPDATE:

  1. Use Jquery to trigger function on Mouse Over - Done
  2. Print in console if link is wikipedia or not using regex matching - Done
  3. Sample Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning - Done
  4. Remove https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ from url - Done
  5. Using Nodejs, trigger python function to get summarised data - Done
  6. Display summarised content in console - Done
  7. Display in pop-up -
  8. Download wikipedia articles -
  9. Abstract articles and store in text files -
  10. Buy Server -
